Currant Library
===============

A tiny general-purpose JavaScript library which I wrote mainly to make my code shorter and more readable.

It's tiny, clean and easy to use â€” [check out the wiki](https://github.com/TheNumberGuy/Currant-Library/wiki)

What it is
----------

You probably have been annoyed by having to write long lines of code every time to do a simple operation. However, massive libraries like jQuery are too big and complicated for your needs. That's how I felt too, so I decided to make my own small JavaScript library for the simplest of things that could just be shorter.

Currant Library has functionality you (probably) use very often, like accessing an HTML element, hiding it or attaching an event handler to it with cross-browser compatibility. With Currant Library, you can easily do it using short and simple functions. It is clean and doesn't mess up your website as long as you're using the functions properly. It's just like you wrote the library yourself!
